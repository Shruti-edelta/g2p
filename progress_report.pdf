(5) Task completed in the month of March 2025:
    a. build G2P model (grapheme to phoneme conversion) using cmudict dataset from NLTK library.
    b. testing G2p model with test data and unseen data.
    c. find TTS dataset (LJSpeech) and PreProcessing this dataset sutaible in my acoustic model.
        - Text analysis step
        - audio PreProcessing (silence remove,noise remove,trimming)
    d. In Text analysis, implement G2P model to convert text to phonemes.
    e. find acoustic model (text to mel-spectrogram) architecture.
